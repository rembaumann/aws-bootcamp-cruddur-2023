# Week 0 - Billing and Architecture

## Overal Notes
Really excited to get through this course! I am a classic "have done lots of certs but dont have enough hands on experience guy", so even some of the practice this week was really helpful. I have been continually updating the homework for this week, so hopefully this was not graded before my most recent modification. I started off creating my own Github repo from scratch until I realized there was a template, so once completing the initial lessons I coppied the template and then have moved all of my files over. Hope that everything is still in working order and logical.

### Generate AWS Credentials
Did this, but will not share any more than that :)
 
### Installed AWS CLI
 
 I installed the AWS CLI into Gitpod usint the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), using the linux instructions. You can validate this by my [.gitpod.yml](https://github.com/rembaumann/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/.gitpod.yml) file in the root directory of this repo, as well as this image of Gitpod

## Additional Challenge
Because I already had existing an AWS account, I wanted to create a brand new account to logically separate all of the bootcamp resources, as well as utilize the free tier. So, I created a new account, and made an organization within my existing account
