### Configure custom logger to send to CloudWatch Logs

Cloudwatch was also implemented to send logs to a "Crudder" log group. We implemented a log on the "home_activities" page to test sending logs. These are commented out in the current code to reduce costs.

### Integrate Rollbar and capture and error

I first integrated rollbar to show API data capture, as shown below

I then forced an error in order to capture this behavior in Rollbar. This will be used later on to triage errors in the app.
